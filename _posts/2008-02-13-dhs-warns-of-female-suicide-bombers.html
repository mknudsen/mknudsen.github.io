<blockquote>
<p>First paragraph: Terrorists increasingly favor using women as suicide bombers to thwart security and draw attention to their causes, a new FBI-Department of Homeland Security assessment concludes. Photo caption: Female suicide bombers can use devices to make them appear pregnant, a security assessment says. Second paragraph: The assessment said the agencies "have no specific, credible intelligence indicating that terrorist organizations intend to utilize female suicide bombers against targets in the homeland." Does the DHS think we're idiots or something?</p>
