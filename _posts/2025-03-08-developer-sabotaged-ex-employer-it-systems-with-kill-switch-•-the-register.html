<figure>  <blockquote>    <p>Lu created what <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-convicted-sabotaging-his-employers-computer-systems-and-deleting-data">the Feds described</a> as a kill switch – more like a dead man's switch, perhaps – that would lock every employee out of their accounts if his credentials were ever revoked, and named the code IsDLEnabledinAD, as in "Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory."</p>
<p>When his position was eventually terminated on September 9, 2019, the kill switch was activated and thousands of employees around the world were locked out of the network, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage, it is said.</p>
