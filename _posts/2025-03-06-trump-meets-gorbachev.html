<figure>  <blockquote>    <p>The former head of Kazakhstan’s intelligence service, Alnur Mussayev, recently <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-recruited-kgb-codename-180759277.html?">claimed in a Facebook post</a> that Donald Trump was recruited by the KGB in 1987, when the 40-year-old real-estate mogul first visited Moscow.</p>

<p>The allegation would, if true, be a bombshell. Mussayev provides no documentary evidence —but then how could he? He alleged that Trump’s file is in Vladimir Putin’s hands.</p>  </blockquote>  <figcaption>    <cite>thehill.com</cite>, in "<cite><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5162890-assessing-new-allegations-that-trump-was-recruited-by-the-kgb/">Assessing new allegations that Trump was recruited by the KGB</a></cite>"  </figcaption></figure>

<p>Inspired by this I looked for some news reports about Trump in the eighties, found one mentioning he was to be visited by Gorbachev in New York.</p>

<figure>  <blockquote>    Mr. Trump lost no time in deciding how to guide the Soviet leader through his Fifth Avenue tower, saying he would start by showing off the peach-colored marble in the tower's shopping atrium. ''I'm going to show his wife the stores,'' Mr. Trump said.  </blockquote>  <figcaption>    <cite>archive.is</cite>, in "<cite><a href="https://archive.is/s1e2l#selection-659.0-659.250">For Gorbachev, Met Museum And Trump Tower Visits Due - The New York Times</a></cite>"  </figcaption></figure>

<p>But of course the real story is much dumber than that:</p>

<figure>  <blockquote>    Trump told reporters that the Russians had called him and said that Gorbachev wanted to tour Trump Tower. However, Gorbachev never showed. Instead, <a class="af nx" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/from-russia-with-love?utm_term=.ju5pa1GRw#.mrQqvkx8e" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Trump was tricked into meeting a Gorbachev impersonator</a> who showed up at Trump Tower at the behest of A Current Affair.  </blockquote>  <figcaption>    <cite>medium.com</cite>, in "<cite><a href="https://medium.com/@abbievansickle/timeline-of-trumps-relationship-to-russia-5e78c7e7f480">Confused by Trump’s Russia Ties?

<p>Looks like Trump was onto it quite quickly, see minute 1:30. Guess he knows his russian leaders.</p>
