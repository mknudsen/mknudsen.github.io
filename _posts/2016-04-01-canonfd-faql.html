<blockquote><a href="http://canonfd.farah.cl/index.html#extenders"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mounts.jpg" alt="" /></a>The purpose of this FAQL is to compile a lot of small pieces of information, tips and stuff about the Canon FD photography system (comprising SLR cameras, manual focusing lenses and accesories) that doesn't appear in reference manuals or the usual resources. Much of the information here has been taken from comments in the Canon FD mailing list. Suggestions are, obviously, welcome.</p></blockquote>
