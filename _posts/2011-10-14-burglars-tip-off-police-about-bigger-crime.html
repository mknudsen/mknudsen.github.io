<p>I find this fascinating: A central California man has been arrested for possession of child pornography, thanks to a tip from burglars who robbed the man's property, authorities said. I am reminded of the UK story of a burglar finding some military secrets on a laptop -- or perhaps a USB drive -- that he stole, and returning them with a comment that was something like: "I'm a crook; I'm not a bloody traitor."</p>
