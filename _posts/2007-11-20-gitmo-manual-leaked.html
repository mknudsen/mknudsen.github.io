<p>A 2003 "Camp Delta Standard Operating Procedures" manual has been leaked to the Internet. This is the same manual that the ACLU has unsuccessfully sued the government to get a copy of. Others can debate the legality of some of the procedures; I'm interested in comments about the security. See, for example, this quote on page 27.3: (b) Upon arrival will enter the gate by entering the number (1998) in the combination lock (c) Proceed to the junction box with the number (7012-83) Breaker Box and open the boc. The number for the lock on the breaker box is (224).</p>
