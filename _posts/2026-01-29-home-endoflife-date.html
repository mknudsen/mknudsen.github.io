 <figure> <blockquote> <p>End-of-life (EOL) and support information is <a href="https://twitter.com/captn3m0/status/1110504412064239617">often hard to track, or very badly presented</a>.
endoflife.date documents EOL dates and support lifecycles for various products.</p>

<p>endoflife.date aggregates data from various sources and presents it in an understandable and
succinct manner. It also makes the data available using an <a href="/docs/api/v1/">easily accessible API</a>
and has iCalendar support.</p> </blockquote> <figcaption> <cite>endoflife.date</cite>, in "<cite><a href="https://endoflife.date/">Home | endoflife.date</a></cite>" </figcaption> </figure>
