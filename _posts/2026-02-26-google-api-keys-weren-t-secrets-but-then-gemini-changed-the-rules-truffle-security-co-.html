 <figure> <blockquote> <strong>tl;dr</strong> Google spent over a decade telling developers that Google API keys (like those used in Maps, Firebase, etc.) are not secrets. But that's no longer true: Gemini accepts the same keys to access your private data. We scanned millions of websites and found nearly 3,000 Google API keys, originally deployed for public services like Google Maps, that now also authenticate to Gemini even though they were never intended for it. With a valid key, an attacker can access uploaded files, cached data, and charge LLM-usage to your account. Even Google themselves had old public API keys, which they thought were non-sensitive, that we could use to access Google’s internal Gemini. </blockquote> <figcaption> <cite>trufflesecurity.com</cite>, in "<cite><a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-api-keys-werent-secrets-but-then-gemini-changed-the-rules">Google API Keys Weren't Secrets.
