Works well with Outlook too, if you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-your-calendar-in-outlook-on-the-web-7ecef8ae-139c-40d9-bae2-a23977ee58d5">share your Outlook calendar</a> to the mac calendar app. For searching I created a small alias <code>alias calgrep="icalBuddy 'eventsToday+21'|grep -i -A2"</code> to search events in the next 3 weeks by name.
