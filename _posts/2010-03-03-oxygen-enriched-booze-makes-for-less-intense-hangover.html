<blockquote>
<p>To test their idea, 49 volunteers were fed sets of equally alcoholic drinks, with one group drinking beverages that had been oxygen-enriched up to 20-25 parts per million, and the control group drinking beverages with oxygen at 8 ppm. They found that the oxygenated drinks were absorbed as fast as the regular drinks, and got the participants just as drunk. But, when testing their blood alcohol levels, researchers found that the oxygenation helped the volunteers scrub alcohol from their systems, getting them down to a 0.05 percent BAC about half an hour faster.</p>
