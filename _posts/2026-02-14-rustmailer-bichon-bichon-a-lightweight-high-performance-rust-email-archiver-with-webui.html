 <figure> <blockquote> <p>Bichon is an open-source email archiving system that <strong>synchronizes emails from IMAP servers</strong>, <strong>indexes them for full-text search</strong>, and provides a <strong>REST API</strong> for programmatic access.
<strong>Unlike email clients</strong>, Bichon is designed for <strong>archiving and searching</strong> rather than sending/receiving emails. It runs as a <strong>standalone server application</strong> that continuously synchronizes configured email accounts and maintains a <strong>searchable local archive</strong>.
Built in Rust, it requires no external dependencies and provides fast, efficient email archiving, management, and search through a built-in WebUI. Its name is inspired by the puppy my daughter adopted last month.</p>

<p>This was very straightforward to setup and now syncs / backups two of my mail accounts. Although syncing a google mail account is a bit of a PITA, as it requires to setup a custom Google Cloud application along with an OAuth client.</p>
