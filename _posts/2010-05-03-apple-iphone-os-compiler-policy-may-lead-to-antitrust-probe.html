<p>The US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission may be considering an investigation into Apple's decision to block iPhone OS apps created by many third-party compilers. According to insiders speaking to the New York Post, the two organizations are "locked in negotiations" over which one will launch the antitrust inquiry, and the decision is mere "days away."</p>
