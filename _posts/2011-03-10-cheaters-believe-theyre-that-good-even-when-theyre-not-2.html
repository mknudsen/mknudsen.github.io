<p>The researchers found one factor that makes this phenomenon even worse: social recognition. After taking the first test, a group of randomly assigned participants were given certificates and told that they scored "higher than average." Those participants that had seen the answers and gotten a certificate overestimated their future performance more than all other groups. Social recognition—here, in the form of a certificate—intensifies self-deception.</p>
