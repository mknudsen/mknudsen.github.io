<blockquote>The android-apt plugin assists in working with annotation processors in combination with Android Studio. It has two purposes:</p>
<p>Allow to configure a compile time only annotation processor as a dependency, not including the artifact in the final APK or library</p>
<p>Set up the source paths so that code that is generated from the annotation processor is correctly picked up by Android Studio.</p>
<p>This plugin requires the android or android-library plugin (version 0.9.x or up) to be configured on your project.</p></blockquote>
