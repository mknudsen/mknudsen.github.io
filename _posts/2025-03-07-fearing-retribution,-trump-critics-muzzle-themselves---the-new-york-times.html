He revoked the security details of high-profile critics <a href="https://archive.is/o/hhVVY/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-pentagon-milley-security.html">like Gen. Mark A. Milley</a>, a retired Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman who faces death threats from Iran, and said he would <a href="https://archive.is/o/hhVVY/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/trump-jack-smith-law-firm-security.html">pull the security clearances</a> of lawyers at a prominent law firm who are representing Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him.</div>
