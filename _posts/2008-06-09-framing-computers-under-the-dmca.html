<p>Researchers from the University of Washington have demonstrated how lousy the MPAA/RIAA/etc tactics are by successfuly framing printers on their network. These printers, who can't download anything, received over 400 takedown notices: The researchers rigged the software agents to implicate three laserjet printers, which were then accused in takedown letters by the M.P.A.A. of downloading copies of “Iron Man” and the latest Indiana Jones film.
