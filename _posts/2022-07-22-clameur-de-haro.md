## Clameur de haro

> The [clameur de haro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clameur_de_haro) (French pronunciation: ​[klamœʁ də aʁo]) is an ancient legal injunction of restraint employed by a person who believes they are being wronged by another at that moment. It survives as a fully enforceable law to this day in the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey, and is used, albeit infrequently, for matters affecting land.
