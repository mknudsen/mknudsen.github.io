<p>Habe auf der Seite von <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/about/" title="Dem Scott seine Seite.">Scott Berkun</a> einen sehr Interessanten Text gefunden:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with smart people is that they like to be right and sometimes will defend  		ideas to the death rather than admit they&rsquo;re wrong. This is bad. Worse, if they  		got away with it when they were young (say, because they were smarter than their parents,  		their friends, and their parent&rsquo;s friends) they&rsquo;ve probably built an ego  		around being right, and will therefore defend their perfect record of invented righteousness  		to the death. Smart people often fall into the trap of preferring to be right even if  		it&rsquo;s based in delusion, or results in them, or their loved ones, becoming miserable.  		(Somewhere in your town there is a row of graves at the cemetery, called smartypants  		lane, filled with people who were buried at poorly attended funerals, whose headstones  		say &ldquo;Well, at least I was right.&rdquo;)</p></blockquote>
